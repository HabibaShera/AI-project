# **Abstract**
In the hospitals' database, there are many data related to patients like gender, age, hypertension, the average glucose level in blood, body mass index, etc.
From these data, we can know if the patient has stroke or not by using machine learning algorithms.

# **Project Idea**
We build a website to help hostiptals to determine if the patient has stroke or not with accuracy 99% by using Logistic Regression algorithm to build a machine learning model.

# **Description Design**
<img src='https://github.com/HabibaShera/AI-project/blob/main/description_design.png?raw=true'>

- cleaning data : *by checking missing values and dealing with outliers.*
- feature selection : *choose features which lead to best accuracy*
- machine learning : *try different algorithms like KNN, decision tree, dummy classifer, simple deep neural network, etc.*
> <font color='grey'>After that we choose the model with the best accuracy and save it in a pickle file to use it while building API.</font>
- build & host API : *using **FastAPI**, we build API and host it on **heroku**.*

# **Tools**
| Website Mobile Application  | Backend  | Machine Learning  |
| :------------: | :------------: | :------------: |
| Flutter  | FastApi  | python  |
